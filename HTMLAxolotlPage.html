                <h2>Neoteny</h2>
                <p>The meaning of the word neoteny, is the continued possesion of ones jvenile characteristics/features. Unlike some species which may have partial neoteny, Axolotls (also known as Amystoma Mexicanum) can be seen to have full neoteny which causes the axolotls to keep their external gills (the feathery looking parts coming off of their heads) when they mature, unlike other species in the salamander family.</p>

                <h2>Colour</h2>
                <p>Axolotls have four genes which denote their pigmentation.</p>
                <h3>Which are known as the following:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leucistic (pale pink with black eyes)</li>
                    <li>Xanthic (grey with black eyes)</li>
                    <li>Albino (Pale pink or white, with red eyes)</li>
                    <li>Melanoid (all black or dark blue)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Feeding habits</h2>
                <p>As carnivores, axolotls have a meat based diet. In the wild this will usually consist of anything small enough for them to swallow whole that they can find as bottom dewwling aquatic creatures, although (and while not unusual) they may eat other salamanders; especially when young which can quite often lead to;</p>
                <h2>FILIAL CANNIBALISM</h2>
                <p>(the act of eating ones offspring)</p>
                <p>This will only happen if there is little to no prey for them to eat. It will only be because they are hungry and cannot get enough to eat, especially with hatchlings who need a lot of calories due to how quickly they can mature.</p>
